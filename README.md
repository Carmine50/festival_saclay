##################### FESTIVAL APP ###########################

#to run the register point code execute:
python3 register_gui.py
#do not close and open the program as for now there is no
#database but only a simple file called "INFO.txt" where
#data are saved
#every time the program starts the id count restart 
#from the beginning - this is only a temporary 
#simple solution only to show the working 
#principle od the App






#to run the paying point code execute:
python3 general_gui.py



#pay attention to the location of the gp function
#look at the register_gui.py file and the gp
#variable if it corresponds to your same domain

#this "Project" folder should be positioned into
#DevJavaCard folder to have a fast execution


#the only python3 package to download is
#tinker



#in case there is any problem do not hesitate
#to contact me 
#carmine.rizzi@polytechnique.edu
